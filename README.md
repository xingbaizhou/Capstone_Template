## 1. Introduction

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a plant classification machine learning project. The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify different plant species based on their images. The project uses machine learning techniques and image processing to achieve the classification task.

## 2. Project Overview

In this project, I explored the field of computer vision and machine learning to develop a plant classification system. I collected the dataset from a Kaggle plant classification competition. Next, I extracted relevant features from the images to represent the plant characteristics for image data preprocessing. Then, I will train and evaluate different machine-learning models to find the best classifier for this specific task.

## 3. Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of a large collection of plant images, each folder's name is labelled with its corresponding species.

## 4. Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (choose one for deep learning)
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 5. Data Preprocessing

Before feeding the images into the machine learning models, I did an EDA on the dataset to explore the pixel intensity, the distribution of RGB pixel datas in the images 
perform data preprocessing.

## 6. Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves extracting relevant features from the images that can effectively represent the plant's characteristics. I will be using CNN models and confusion matrixes.

## 7. Model Selection

In this project, we explore various machine learning models, including but not limited to:
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Confusion Matrix
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
